## Exhortation to Righteousness, the Key to Life

###### 1 Love righteousness,[^b] you who judge the earth;[^A]  
    think of the LORD in goodness,  
    and seek him in integrity of heart;[^B]  

###### 2 Because he is found by those who do not test him,  
    and manifests himself to those who do not disbelieve him.[^C]  

###### 3 For perverse counsels separate people from God,  
    and his power, put to the proof, rebukes the foolhardy;[^D]  

###### 4 [^c]Because into a soul that plots evil wisdom does not enter,  
    nor does she dwell in a body under debt of sin.[^E]  

###### 5 For the holy spirit of discipline[^d] flees deceit  
    and withdraws from senseless counsels  
    and is rebuked when unrighteousness occurs.[^F]

###### 6 For wisdom is a kindly spirit,  
    yet she does not acquit blasphemous lips;  
Because God is the witness of the inmost self[^G]  
    and the sure observer of the heart  
    and the listener to the tongue.[^H]  

###### 7 For the spirit of the LORD fills the world,[^I]  
    is all-embracing, and knows whatever is said.  

###### 8 Therefore those who utter wicked things will not go unnoticed,  
    nor will chastising condemnation pass them by.[^J]  

###### 9 For the devices of the wicked shall be scrutinized,  
    and the sound of their words shall reach the LORD,  
    for the chastisement of their transgressions;  

###### 10 Because a jealous ear hearkens to everything,[^K]  
    and discordant grumblings are not secret.  

###### 11 Therefore guard against profitless grumbling,  
    and from calumny[^e] withhold your tongues;  
For a stealthy utterance will not go unpunished,  
    and a lying mouth destroys the soul.

###### 12 Do not court death[^f] by your erring way of life,  
    nor draw to yourselves destruction by the works of your hands.  

###### 13 Because God did not make death,[^L]  
    nor does he rejoice in the destruction of the living.  

###### 14 For he fashioned all things that they might have being,  
    and the creatures of the world are wholesome;  
There is not a destructive drug among them  
    nor any domain of Hades[^g] on earth,  

###### 15 For righteousness is undying.[^h][^M]

## The Wicked Reject Immortality and Righteousness Alike

###### 16 It was the wicked who with hands and words invited death,  
    considered it a friend, and pined for it,  
    and made a covenant with it,  
Because they deserve to be allied with it.[^N]

### Footnotes
[^a]: 1:1–6:21 The reward is the gift of immortality, to the righteous ([1:15]; [3:1–3]), but not to the wicked ([5:1–13]). Contrasts between these two groups dominate [chaps. 1–5]. The philosophy of the wicked and their persecution of the righteous are dramatically presented in [1:16–2:24]. New light is shed on the suffering of the righteous ([3:1–9]), childlessness ([3:13–15]), and premature death ([4:7–16])—in contrast to the fate of the wicked ([3:10–12], [16–19]; [4:3–6], [17–20]).
[^b]: 1:1 <b class="catch-word">Righteousness**: not merely the cardinal virtue of justice (cf. [8:7]), but the universal moral quality which is the application of wisdom to moral conduct. <b class="catch-word">You who judge**: “judges” and “kings” (cf. [6:1]) are addressed in accordance with the literary customs of the times and with the putative Solomonic authorship, but the real audience is the Jewish community.
[^c]: 1:4 In these verses personified Wisdom is identified with the spirit of the Lord; so also in [9:17].
[^d]: 1:5 <b class="catch-word">Discipline**: here and elsewhere, another name for Wisdom.
[^e]: 1:11 <b class="catch-word">Calumny**: speech against God and divine providence is meant.
[^f]: 1:12 <b class="catch-word">Death**: as will become clear, the author is not speaking of physical death but of spiritual death, the eternal separation from God.
[^g]: 1:14 <b class="catch-word">Hades**: the Greek term for the Hebrew Sheol, the dwelling place of the dead.
[^h]: 1:15 <b class="catch-word">Undying**: immortality is not seen as an innate quality of the soul but as a gift of God to the righteous.
