# Galatians 1 (New American Bible (Revised Edition))
## Chapter 1
<b class="inline-h3">Greeting.**[^a] 
###### 1 [^A]Paul, an apostle[^b] not from human beings nor through a human being but through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead,[^B]  
###### 2 [^c]and all the brothers who are with me, to the churches of Galatia:  
###### 3 grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,  
###### 4 [^d]who gave himself for our sins that he might rescue us from the present evil age in accord with the will of our God and Father,[^C]  
###### 5 to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.[^D]

###### 6 [^E]I am amazed that you are so quickly forsaking the one who called you[^f] by [the] grace [of Christ] for a different gospel  
###### 7 (not that there is another). But there are some who are disturbing you and wish to pervert the gospel of Christ.  
###### 8 [^F]But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach [to you] a gospel other than the one that we preached to you, let that one be accursed![^g]  
###### 9 As we have said before, and now I say again, if anyone preaches to you a gospel other than the one that you received, let that one be accursed!

###### 10 [^G]Am I now currying favor with human beings or God? Or am I seeking to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a slave of Christ.[^h]
<b class="inline-h3">His Call by Christ.** 
###### 11 [^H]Now I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel preached by me is not of human origin.  
###### 12 For I did not receive it from a human being, nor was I taught it, but it came through a revelation of Jesus Christ.[^j]

###### 13 [^k]For you heard of my former way of life in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it,[^I]  
###### 14 and progressed in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries among my race, since I was even more a zealot for my ancestral traditions.[^J]  
###### 15 But when [God], who from my mother's womb had set me apart and called me through his grace, was pleased[^K]  
###### 16 to reveal his Son to me,[^L] so that I might proclaim him to the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult flesh and blood,[^l]  
###### 17 nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; rather, I went into Arabia[^m] and then returned to Damascus.

###### 18 [^n]Then after three years[^o] I went up to Jerusalem to confer with Cephas and remained with him for fifteen days.[^M]  
###### 19 But I did not see any other of the apostles,[^N] only James the brother of the Lord.[^p]  
###### 20 (As to what I am writing to you, behold, before God, I am not lying.)[^O]  
###### 21 Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.[^P]  
###### 22 And I was unknown personally to the churches of Judea that are in Christ;  
###### 23 they only kept hearing that "the one who once was persecuting us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy."[^Q]  
###### 24 So they glorified God because of me.

### Footnotes
[^a]: 1:1–5 See note on [Rom 1:1–7], concerning the greeting.
[^b]: 1:1 <b class="catch-word">Apostle**: because of attacks on his authority in Galatia, Paul defends his apostleship. He is not an apostle commissioned by a congregation ([Phil 2:25]; [2 Cor 8:23]) or even by prophets ([1 Tm 1:18]; [4:14]) but <b class="catch-word">through Jesus Christ and God the Father**.
[^c]: 1:2 <b class="catch-word">All the brothers**: fellow believers in Christ, male and female; cf. [Gal 3:27–28]. Paul usually mentions the co-sender(s) at the start of a letter, but the use of all is unique, adding weight to the letter. <b class="catch-word">Galatia**: central Turkey more likely than the Roman province of Galatia; see Introduction.
[^d]: 1:4 The greeting in [v 3] is expanded by a christological formula that stresses deliverance through the Lord Jesus from a world dominated by Satan; cf. [2 Cor 4:4]; [Eph 2:2]; [6:12].
[^e]: 1:6–10 In place of the usual thanksgiving (see note on [Rom 1:8]), Paul, with little to be thankful for in the Galatian situation, expresses amazement at the way his converts are deserting the gospel of Christ for a perverted message. He reasserts the one gospel he has preached ([Gal 1:7–9]) and begins to defend himself ([Gal 1:10]).
[^f]: 1:6 <b class="catch-word">The one who called you**: God or Christ, though in actuality Paul was the divine instrument to call the Galatians.
[^g]: 1:8 <b class="catch-word">Accursed**: in Greek, _anathema_; cf. [Rom 9:3]; [1 Cor 12:3]; [16:22].
[^h]: 1:10 This charge by Paul’s opponents, that he sought to conciliate people with flattery and to curry favor with God, might refer to his mission practices (cf. [1 Cor 9:19–23]) but the word <b class="catch-word">still** suggests it refers to his pre-Christian days (cf. [Gal 1:14]; [Phil 3:6]). The self-description <b class="catch-word">slave of Christ** is one Paul often uses in a greeting ([Rom 1:1]).
[^i]: 1:11–2:21 Paul’s presentation on behalf of his message and of his apostleship reflects rhetorical forms of his day: he first narrates the facts about certain past events ([Gal 1:12–2:14]) and then states his contention regarding justification by faith as the gospel message ([Gal 2:15–21]). Further arguments follow from both experience and scripture in [Galatians 3]; [4] before he draws out the ethical consequences ([Gal 5:1–6:10]). The specific facts that he takes up here to show that his gospel is not a human invention ([Gal 1:11]) but <b class="catch-word">came through a revelation of Jesus Christ** ([Gal 1:12]) deal with his own calling as a Christian missionary ([Gal 1:13–17]), his initial relations with the apostles in Jerusalem ([Gal 1:18–24]), a later journey to Jerusalem ([Gal 2:1–10]), and an incident in Antioch involving Cephas and persons from James ([Gal 2:11–14]). The content of Paul’s revealed gospel is then set forth in the heart of the letter ([Gal 2:15–21]).
[^j]: 1:12 Although Paul received his gospel <b class="catch-word">through a revelation** from Christ, this did not exclude his use of early Christian confessional formulations. See note on [Gal 1:4].
[^k]: 1:13–17 Along with [Phil 3:4–11], which also moves from autobiography to its climax in a discussion on justification by faith (cf. [Gal 2:15–21]), this passage is Paul’s chief account of the change from his <b class="catch-word">former way of life** ([Gal 1:13]) to service as a Christian missionary ([Gal 1:16]); cf. [Acts 9:1–22]; [22:4–16]; [26:9–18]. Paul himself does not use the term “conversion” but stresses revelation ([Gal 1:12], [16]). In [Gal 1:15] his language echoes the Old Testament prophetic call of Jeremiah. Unlike the account in Acts (cf. [Acts 22:4–16]), the calling of Paul here includes the mission to proclaim Christ <b class="catch-word">to the Gentiles** ([Gal 1:16]).
[^l]: 1:16 <b class="catch-word">Flesh and blood**: human authorities (cf. [Mt 16:17]; [1 Cor 15:50]). Paul’s apostleship comes from God ([Gal 1:1]).
[^m]: 1:17 <b class="catch-word">Arabia**: probably the region of the Nabataean Arabs, east and south of Damascus.
[^n]: 1:18–24 Paul’s first journey to Jerusalem as a Christian, according to Galatians (cf. [Acts 9:23–31] and the note on [Acts 12:25]). He is quite explicit about contacts there, testifying under oath ([Gal 1:20]). On returning to <b class="catch-word">Syria** (perhaps specifically Damascus, cf. [Gal 1:17]) <b class="catch-word">and Cilicia** (including his home town Tarsus, cf. [Acts 9:30]; [22:3]), Paul most likely engaged in missionary work. He underscores the fact that Christians in Judea knew of him only by reputation.
[^o]: 1:18 <b class="catch-word">After three years**: two years and more, since Paul’s call. To <b class="catch-word">confer with** Cephas may mean simply “pay a visit” or more specifically “get information from” him about Jesus, over a two-week period. <b class="catch-word">Cephas**: Aramaic name of Simon (Peter); cf. [Mt 16:16–18] and the notes there.
[^p]: 1:19 <b class="catch-word">James the brother of the Lord**: not one of the Twelve, but a brother of Jesus (see note on [Mk 6:3]). He played an important role in the Jerusalem church (see note on [Gal 2:9]), the leadership of which he took over from Peter ([Acts 12:17]). Paul may have regarded James as an apostle.
