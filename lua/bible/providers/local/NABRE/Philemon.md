# Philemon (New American Bible (Revised Edition))
<b class="inline-h3">Address and Greeting.** 
###### 1 [^a]Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved and our co-worker,[^A]  
###### 2 to Apphia our sister,[^b] to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church at your house.[^B]  
###### 3 Grace to you and peace[^c] from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.[^C]
<b class="inline-h3">Thanksgiving.** 
###### 4 [^d][^D]I give thanks to my God always, remembering you in my prayers,  
###### 5 as I hear of the love and the faith you have in the Lord Jesus and for all the holy ones,[^e]  
###### 6 so that your partnership in the faith may become effective in recognizing every good there is in us[^f] that leads to Christ.[^E]
<b class="inline-h3">Plea for Onesimus.** 
###### 7 For I have experienced much joy and encouragement[^g] from your love, because the hearts of the holy ones have been refreshed by you, brother.[^F]  
###### 8 Therefore, although I have the full right[^h] in Christ to order you to do what is proper,  
###### 9 I rather urge you out of love, being as I am, Paul, an old man,[^i] and now also a prisoner for Christ Jesus.[^G]  
###### 10 I urge you on behalf of my child Onesimus, whose father I have become in my imprisonment,[^H]  
###### 11 who was once useless to you but is now useful[^j] to [both] you and me.  
###### 12 I am sending him, that is, my own heart, back to you.  
###### 13 I should have liked to retain him for myself, so that he might serve[^k] me on your behalf in my imprisonment for the gospel,[^I]  
###### 14 but I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that the good you do might not be forced but voluntary.[^J]  
###### 15 Perhaps this is why he was away from[^l] you for a while, that you might have him back forever,  
###### 16 no longer as a slave but more than a slave, a brother, beloved especially to me, but even more so to you, as a man[^m] and in the Lord.[^K]  
###### 17 So if you regard me as a partner, welcome him as you would me.  
###### 18 [^n]And if he has done you any injustice or owes you anything, charge it to me.  
###### 19 I, Paul, write this in my own hand: I will pay. May I not tell you that you owe me your very self.[^L]  
###### 20 Yes, brother, may I profit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.

###### 21 With trust in your compliance I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.  
###### 22 At the same time prepare a guest room for me, for I hope to be granted to you through your prayers.[^M]
<b class="inline-h3">Final Greetings.** 
###### 23 Epaphras,[^o] my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,[^N]  
###### 24 as well as Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my co-workers.  
###### 25 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.[^O]

### Footnotes
[^a]: 1 <b class="catch-word">Prisoner**: as often elsewhere (cf. Romans, 1 Corinthians, Galatians especially), the second word in Greek enunciates the theme and sets the tone of the letter. Here it is the prisoner appealing rather than the apostle commanding.
[^b]: 2 <b class="catch-word">Apphia our sister**: sister is here used (like brother) to indicate a fellow Christian. <b class="catch-word">The church at your house**: <b class="catch-word">your** here is singular. It more likely refers to Philemon than to the last one named, Archippus; Philemon is then the owner of the slave Onesimus ([Phlm 10]). An alternate view is that the actual master of the slave is Archippus and that the one to whom the letter is addressed, Philemon, is the most prominent Christian there; see note on [Col 4:17].
[^c]: 3 <b class="catch-word">Grace…and peace**: for this greeting, which may be a combination of Greek and Aramaic epistolary formulae, see note on [Rom 1:1–7].
[^d]: 4 <b class="catch-word">In my prayers**: literally, “at the time of my prayers.”
[^e]: 5 <b class="catch-word">Holy ones**: a common term for members of the Christian community (so also [Phlm 7]).
[^f]: 6 <b class="catch-word">In us**: some good ancient manuscripts have _in you_ (plural). <b class="catch-word">That leads to Christ: leads to** translates the Greek preposition _eis_, indicating direction or purpose.
[^g]: 7 <b class="catch-word">Encouragement**: the Greek word _paraklēsis_ is cognate with the verb translated “urge” in [Phlm 9], [10], and serves as an introduction to Paul’s plea. <b class="catch-word">Hearts**: literally, “bowels,” expressing in Semitic fashion the seat of the emotions, one’s “inmost self.” The same Greek word is used in [Phlm 12] and again in [Phlm 20], where it forms a literary inclusion marking off the body of the letter.
[^h]: 8 <b class="catch-word">Full right**: often translated “boldness,” the Greek word _parrēsia_ connotes the full franchise of speech, as the right of a citizen to speak before the body politic, claimed by the Athenians as their privilege (Euripides).
[^i]: 9 <b class="catch-word">Old man**: some editors conjecture that Paul here used a similar Greek word meaning “ambassador” (cf. [Eph 6:20]). This conjecture heightens the contrast with “prisoner” but is totally without manuscript support.
[^j]: 11 <b class="catch-word">Useless…useful**: here Paul plays on the name Onesimus, which means “useful” or “beneficial.” The verb translated “profit” in [Phlm 20] is cognate.
[^k]: 13 <b class="catch-word">Serve**: the Greek _diakoneō_ could connote a ministry.
[^l]: 15 <b class="catch-word">Was away from**: literally, “was separated from,” but the same verb means simply “left” in [Acts 18:1]. It is a euphemism for his running away.
[^m]: 16 <b class="catch-word">As a man**: literally, “in the flesh.” With this and the following phrase, Paul describes the natural and spiritual orders.
[^n]: 18–19 <b class="catch-word">Charge it to me…I will pay**: technical legal and commercial terms in account keeping and acknowledgment of indebtedness.
[^o]: 23–24 <b class="catch-word">Epaphras**: a Colossian who founded the church there ([Col 1:7]) and perhaps also in Laodicea and Hierapolis ([Col 2:1]; [4:12–13]). <b class="catch-word">Aristarchus**: a native of Thessalonica and fellow worker of Paul ([Acts 19:29]; [20:4]; [27:2]). For Mark, Demas, and Luke, see [2 Tm 4:9–13] and the note there.
