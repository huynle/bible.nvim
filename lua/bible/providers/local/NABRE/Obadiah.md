# Obadiah (New American Bible (Revised Edition))
## Edom's Fall Decreed

###### 1 The vision of Obadiah.  
Thus says the Lord God concerning Edom:  
We have heard a message from the LORD,  
    and a herald has been sent among the nations:  
    "Rise up, so we may go to war against it!"[^A]  

###### 2 Now I make you least among the nations;  
    you are utterly contemptible.  

###### 3 The pride of your heart has deceived you--  
    you who dwell in mountain crevices,  
    in your lofty home,[^a]  
Who say in your heart,  
    "Who will bring me down to earth?"  

###### 4 Though you soar like the eagle,  
    and your nest is set among the stars,  
From there I will bring you down--  
    oracle of the LORD.  

###### 5 If thieves came to you, robbers by night  
    --how you have been destroyed!--  
    would they not steal merely till they had enough?  
If grape pickers came to you,  
    would they not leave some gleanings?[^b][^B]  

###### 6 [^c]How Esau has been searched out,  
    his treasures hunted down!  

###### 7 To the border they have driven you--  
    all your allies;  
Your partners have deceived you,  
    they have overpowered you;  
Those who eat your bread[^d]  
    will replace you with foreigners,  
    who have no understanding.

## Edom's Betrayal of Judah

###### 8 On that day--oracle of the LORD--will I not  
    make the wise disappear from Edom,  
    and understanding from Mount Esau?[^C]  

###### 9 Teman,[^e] your warriors will be terror-stricken,  
    so that everyone on Mount Esau will be cut down.  

###### 10 Because of violence to your brother[^f] Jacob,  
    disgrace will cover you,  
    you will be done away with forever![^D]  

###### 11 On the day you stood by,  
    the day strangers carried off his possessions,  
And foreigners entered his gates  
    and cast lots for Jerusalem,  
    you too were like one of them.[^g][^E]

###### 12 [^h]Do not gloat over the day of your brother,  
    the day of his disaster;  
Do not exult over the people of Judah  
    on the day of their ruin;  
Do not speak haughtily  
    on the day of distress!  

###### 13 Do not enter the gate of my people  
    on the day of their calamity;  
Do not gloat--especially you--over his misfortune  
    on the day of his calamity;  
Do not lay hands upon his possessions  
    on the day of his calamity!  

###### 14 Do not stand at the crossroads  
    to cut down his survivors;  
Do not hand over his fugitives  
    on the day of distress!

## Edom's Fall and Judah's Restoration

###### 15 Near is the day of the LORD[^F]  
    against all the nations!  
As you have done, so will it be done to you,  
    your conduct will come back upon your own head;  

###### 16 As you drank[^i] upon my holy mountain,  
    so will all the nations drink continually.  
Yes, they will drink and swallow,  
    and will become as though they had not been.  

###### 17 But on Mount Zion there will be some who escape;[^j]  
    the mountain will be holy,  
And the house of Jacob will take possession  
    of those who dispossessed them.[^G]  

###### 18 The house of Jacob will be a fire,  
    the house of Joseph a flame,  
    and the house of Esau stubble.  
They will set it ablaze and devour it;  
    none will survive of the house of Esau,  
    for the LORD has spoken.

###### 19 They will take possession of the Negeb,[^k] Mount Esau, the Shephelah, and Philistia, possess the countryside of Ephraim, the countryside of Samaria, Benjamin, and Gilead.[^H]  
###### 20 The exiles of this Israelite army will possess the Canaanite land as far as Zarephath,[^l] and the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad will possess the cities of the Negeb.  
###### 21 And deliverers[^m] will ascend Mount Zion to rule Mount Esau, and the kingship shall be the LORD's.

### Footnotes
[^a]: 3 Edom occupied the mountains southeast of Israel and the Dead Sea.
[^b]: 5 Something of value may escape the thief, and the grape picker always leaves something for the gleaners, but God’s devastation of Edom will be complete.
[^c]: 6 With the past tense in [vv. 5–7], the prophet presents a future event as if it had already happened.
[^d]: 7 <b class="catch-word">Those who eat your bread**: alliances were often established by covenant meals (cf. [Gn 31:44–46]). When Edom is destroyed, foreigners will replace the Edomites, who were known for wisdom (cf. [v. 8]; [Jer 49:7]; [Jb 2:11]).
[^e]: 9 <b class="catch-word">Teman**: a synonym for Edom; perhaps the name of a region or a city, the part representing the whole. <b class="catch-word">Mount Esau**: whatever its geographic reference, the phrase is an effective representation of Edom’s arrogance.
[^f]: 10 <b class="catch-word">Your brother**: used with a double meaning referring to the common lineage of Israel and Edom, in which their ancestors were brothers, Jacob and Esau ([Gn 25:19–26]), and referring also to their political alliance, in which allies were called brothers (cf. [Am 1:9], [11]).
[^g]: 11 In 587 B.C., Edomites joined the invading Babylonian forces ([v. 13]) and captured escaping Judahites. The destruction of Jerusalem strengthened and expanded Edom’s hold on Judah’s southern territory.
[^h]: 12–14 The commands in [vv. 12–14] are not to be understood as future prohibitions but as descriptions of crimes Edom in fact already committed on the day of Jerusalem’s fall described in [v. 11].
[^i]: 16 <b class="catch-word">As you drank**: i.e., Judah has suffered the punishment of divine wrath in 587 B.C. The oracle promises a similar fate for the nations, especially Edom ([v. 18]). The metaphor “drinking the cup of God’s wrath” occurs often in the Bible; cf. [Jb 21:20]; [Is 51:17–23]; [Jer 25:15–16]; [Rev 14:10].
[^j]: 17–19 The Israelites will be restored and will occupy the lands of those who oppressed them. The survivors of Judah will be rejoined by the returned exiles from northern Israel.
[^k]: 19 <b class="catch-word">Negeb**: the area south of Judah and west of Edom. <b class="catch-word">Gilead**: east of the Jordan River.
[^l]: 20 <b class="catch-word">Zarephath**: a town in Phoenicia, north of Tyre; cf. [1 Kgs 17:10]. <b class="catch-word">Sepharad**: perhaps Sardis in western Asia Minor. The later rabbis thought it was Spain.
[^m]: 21 <b class="catch-word">Deliverers**: the victorious Israelites who will rule over their enemies, as the ancient judges did; cf. [Jgs 3:9], [15], [31]; [10:1].
