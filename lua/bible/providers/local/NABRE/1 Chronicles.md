### Footnotes
[^a]: 1:1–9:34 The Chronicler’s intention seems to have been to retell, from his particular viewpoint, the story of God’s people from creation down to his own day. Since his primary interest was the history of David and the Davidic dynasty of Judah, he hurries through everything that preceded the death of Saul, David’s predecessor as king, by the use of genealogical lists. The sources for these genealogies are mostly the books, already largely in their present form in the Chronicler’s time, that eventually formed the Hebrew canon. For any given portion of these chapters, see the cross-references to their scriptural sources.
[^b]: 1:19 <b class="catch-word">Divided**: see note on [Gn 10:25].
[^c]: 1:38 <b class="catch-word">Seir**: another name for Esau ([v. 35]) or Edom ([v. 43]).
