# Nahum 1 (New American Bible (Revised Edition))
## Chapter 1

###### 1 Oracle[^a] concerning Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum of Elkosh.

## God's Terrifying Appearance

###### 2 [^b]A jealous and avenging God[^c] is the LORD,  
    an avenger is the LORD, full of wrath;  
The LORD takes vengeance on his adversaries,  
    and rages against his enemies;  

###### 3 The LORD is slow to anger, yet great in power;  
    the LORD will not leave the guilty unpunished.[^A]  
In stormwind[^d] and tempest he comes,  
    and clouds are the dust at his feet;  

###### 4 He roars at the sea and leaves it dry,  
    and all the rivers he dries up.  
Laid low are Bashan and Carmel,  
    and the bloom of Lebanon withers;[^e]  

###### 5 The mountains quake before him,  
    and the hills dissolve;  
The earth is laid waste before him,  
    the world and all who dwell in it.  

###### 6 [^f]Before his wrath, who can stand firm,  
    and who can face his blazing anger?[^B]  
His fury is poured out like fire,  
    and boulders break apart before him.  

###### 7 The LORD is good to those who wait for him,  
    a refuge on the day of distress,  
Taking care of those who look to him for protection,  

###### 8     when the flood rages;  
He makes an end of his opponents,  
    and pursues his enemies into darkness.

## Nineveh's Judgment and Judah's Restoration

###### 9 What do you plot against the LORD,  
    the one about to bring total destruction?  
    No opponent rises a second time!  

###### 10 [^g]Like a thorny thicket, they are tangled,  
    and like drunkards, they are drunk;  
    like dry stubble, they are utterly consumed.  

###### 11 From you has come  
    one plotting evil against the LORD,  
    one giving sinister counsel.[^h]  

###### 12 Thus says the LORD:  
    though fully intact and so numerous,  
    they[^i] shall be mown down and disappear.  
Though I have humbled you,  
    I will humble you no more.  

###### 13 Now I will break his yoke off of you,  
    and tear off your bonds.[^C]

###### 14 The LORD has commanded regarding you:[^j]  
    no descendant will again bear your name;  
From the house of your gods I will abolish  
    the carved and the molten image;  
    I will make your grave a dung heap.
