# 1 Thessalonians 1 (New American Bible (Revised Edition))
## Chapter 1
<b class="inline-h3">Greeting.** 
###### 1 [^a][^A]Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: grace to you and peace.
<b class="inline-h3">Thanksgiving for Their Faith.** 
###### 2 We give thanks to God always for all of you, remembering you in our prayers, unceasingly[^B]  
###### 3 calling to mind your work of faith and labor of love and endurance in hope[^b] of our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father,  
###### 4 knowing, brothers loved by God, how you were chosen.[^C]  
###### 5 For our gospel did not come to you in word alone, but also in power and in the holy Spirit and [with] much conviction. You know what sort of people we were [among] you for your sake.[^D]  
###### 6 And you became imitators[^c] of us and of the Lord, receiving the word in great affliction, with joy from the holy Spirit,  
###### 7 so that you became a model for all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia.[^E]  
###### 8 For from you the word of the Lord has sounded forth not only in Macedonia and [in] Achaia, but in every place your faith in God has gone forth, so that we have no need to say anything.[^F]  
###### 9 For they themselves openly declare about us what sort of reception we had among you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God[^G]  
###### 10 and to await his Son from heaven, whom he raised from [the] dead, Jesus, who delivers us from the coming wrath.[^H]

### Footnotes
[^a]: 1:1 On the address, see note on [Rom 1:1–7].
[^b]: 1:3 <b class="catch-word">Faith…love…hope**: this, along with [1 Thes 5:8], is the earliest mention in Christian literature of the three “theological virtues” (see [1 Cor 13:13]). The order here stresses eschatological hope, in line with the letter’s emphasis on the Lord’s second, triumphal coming, or parousia ([1 Thes 1:10]; [2:12], [19]; [3:13]; [4:13–5:11]; [5:23]).
[^c]: 1:6 <b class="catch-word">Imitators**: the Pauline theme of “imitation” (see [1 Thes 2:14]; [1 Cor 4:16]; [11:1]; [2 Thes 3:9]) is rooted in Paul’s view of solidarity in Christ through sharing in Jesus’ cross and in the Spirit of the risen Lord.
