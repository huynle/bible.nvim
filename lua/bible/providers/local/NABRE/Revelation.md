# Revelation 1 (New American Bible (Revised Edition))
## Chapter 1

###### 1 The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show his servants what must happen soon. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John,[^A]  
###### 2 who gives witness to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ by reporting what he saw.  
###### 3 Blessed is the one[^b] who reads aloud and blessed are those who listen to this prophetic message and heed what is written in it, for the appointed time is near.[^B]
<b class="inline-h3">Greeting.**[^c]  
###### 4 John, to the seven churches in Asia:[^d] grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits before his throne,[^C]  
###### 5 and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead and ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and has freed us[^e] from our sins by his blood,[^D]  
###### 6 who has made us into a kingdom, priests for his God and Father, to him be glory and power forever [and ever]. Amen.[^E]

###### 7 Behold, he is coming amid the clouds,  
    and every eye will see him,  
    even those who pierced him.  
All the peoples of the earth will lament him.  
    Yes. Amen.[^F]

###### 8 "I am the Alpha and the Omega,"[^f] says the Lord God, "the one who is and who was and who is to come, the almighty."[^G]
<b class="inline-h3">The First Vision.**[^g]  
###### 9 I, John, your brother, who share with you the distress, the kingdom, and the endurance we have in Jesus, found myself on the island called Patmos[^h] because I proclaimed God's word and gave testimony to Jesus.  
###### 10 I was caught up in spirit on the Lord's day[^i] and heard behind me a voice as loud as a trumpet,  
###### 11 which said, "Write on a scroll[^j] what you see and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea."  
###### 12 [^k]Then I turned to see whose voice it was that spoke to me, and when I turned, I saw seven gold lampstands  
###### 13 and in the midst of the lampstands one like a son of man,[^l] wearing an ankle-length robe, with a gold sash around his chest.[^H]  
###### 14 The hair of his head was as white as white wool or as snow,[^m] and his eyes were like a fiery flame.  
###### 15 His feet were like polished brass refined in a furnace,[^n] and his voice was like the sound of rushing water.  
###### 16 In his right hand he held seven stars.[^o] A sharp two-edged sword came out of his mouth, and his face shone like the sun at its brightest.[^I]

###### 17 When I caught sight of him, I fell down at his feet as though dead.[^p] He touched me with his right hand and said, "Do not be afraid. I am the first and the last,[^J]  
###### 18 the one who lives. Once I was dead, but now I am alive forever and ever. I hold the keys to death and the netherworld.[^q]  
###### 19 Write down, therefore, what you have seen, and what is happening, and what will happen afterwards.[^r]  
###### 20 This is the secret meaning[^s] of the seven stars you saw in my right hand, and of the seven gold lampstands: the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.

### Footnotes
[^a]: 1:1–3 This prologue describes the source, contents, and audience of the book and forms an inclusion with the epilogue ([Rev 22:6–21]), with its similar themes and expressions.
[^b]: 1:3 <b class="catch-word">Blessed is the one**: this is the first of seven beatitudes in this book; the others are in [Rev 14:13]; [16:15]; [19:9]; [20:6]; [22:7], [14]. <b class="catch-word">This prophetic message**: literally, “the words of the prophecy”; so [Rev 22:7], [10], [18], [19] by inclusion. <b class="catch-word">The appointed time**: when Jesus will return in glory; cf. [Rev 1:7]; [3:11]; [22:7], [10], [12], [20].
[^c]: 1:4–8 Although Revelation begins and ends ([Rev 22:21]) with Christian epistolary formulae, there is nothing between [Rev 4]; [22] resembling a letter. The author here employs the standard word order for greetings in Greek letter writing: “N. to N., greetings…”; see note on [Rom 1:1].
[^d]: 1:4 <b class="catch-word">Seven churches in Asia**: Asia refers to the Roman province of that name in western Asia Minor (modern Turkey); these representative churches are mentioned by name in [Rev 1:11], and each is the recipient of a message ([Rev 2:1–3:22]). <b class="catch-word">Seven** is the biblical number suggesting fullness and completeness; thus the seer is writing for the whole church.
[^e]: 1:5 <b class="catch-word">Freed us**: the majority of Greek manuscripts and several early versions read “washed us”; but “freed us” is supported by the best manuscripts and fits well with Old Testament imagery, e.g., [Is 40:2].
[^f]: 1:8 <b class="catch-word">The Alpha and the Omega**: the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet. In [Rev 22:13] the same words occur together with the expressions “the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End”; cf. [Rev 1:17]; [2:8]; [21:6]; [Is 41:4]; [44:6].
[^g]: 1:9–20 In this first vision, the seer is commanded to write what he sees to the seven churches ([Rev 1:9–11]). He sees Christ in glory, whom he depicts in stock apocalyptic imagery ([Rev 1:12–16]), and hears him describe himself in terms meant to encourage Christians by emphasizing his victory over death ([Rev 1:17–20]).
[^h]: 1:9 <b class="catch-word">Island called Patmos**: one of the Sporades islands in the Aegean Sea, some fifty miles south of Ephesus, used by the Romans as a penal colony. <b class="catch-word">Because I proclaimed God’s word**: literally, “on account of God’s word.”
[^i]: 1:10 <b class="catch-word">The Lord’s day**: Sunday. <b class="catch-word">As loud as a trumpet**: the imagery is derived from the theophany at Sinai ([Ex 19:16], [19]; cf. [Hb 12:19] and the trumpet in other eschatological settings in [Is 27:13]; [Jl 2:1]; [Mt 24:31]; [1 Cor 15:52]; [1 Thes 4:16]).
[^j]: 1:11 <b class="catch-word">Scroll**: a papyrus roll.
[^k]: 1:12–16 A symbolic description of Christ in glory. The metaphorical language is not to be understood literally; cf. Introduction.
[^l]: 1:13 <b class="catch-word">Son of man**: see note on [Mk 8:31]. <b class="catch-word">Ankle-length robe**: Christ is priest; cf. [Ex 28:4]; [29:5]; [Wis 18:24]; [Zec 3:4]. <b class="catch-word">Gold sash**: Christ is king; cf. [Ex 28:4]; [1 Mc 10:89]; [11:58]; [Dn 10:5].
[^m]: 1:14 <b class="catch-word">Hair…as white as white wool or as snow**: Christ is eternal, clothed with the dignity that belonged to the “Ancient of Days”; cf. [Rev 1:18]; [Dn 7:9]. <b class="catch-word">His eyes were like a fiery flame**: Christ is portrayed as all-knowing; cf. [Rev 2:23]; [Ps 7:10]; [Jer 17:10]; and similar expressions in [Rev 2:18]; [19:12]; cf. [Dn 10:6].
[^n]: 1:15 <b class="catch-word">His feet…furnace**: Christ is depicted as unchangeable; cf. [Ez 1:27]; [Dn 10:6]. The Greek word translated “refined” is unconnected grammatically with any other word in the sentence. <b class="catch-word">His voice…water**: Christ speaks with divine authority; cf. [Ez 1:24].
[^o]: 1:16 <b class="catch-word">Seven stars**: in the pagan world, Mithras and the Caesars were represented with seven stars in their right hand, symbolizing their universal dominion. <b class="catch-word">A sharp two-edged sword**: this refers to the word of God (cf. [Eph 6:17]; [Hb 4:12]) that will destroy unrepentant sinners; cf. [Rev 2:16]; [19:15]; [Wis 18:15]; [Is 11:4]; [49:2]. <b class="catch-word">His face…brightest**: this symbolizes the divine majesty of Christ; cf. [Rev 10:1]; [21:23]; [Jgs 5:31]; [Is 60:19]; [Mt 17:2].
[^p]: 1:17 It was an Old Testament belief that for sinful human beings to see God was to die; cf. [Ex 19:21]; [33:20]; [Jgs 6:22–23]; [Is 6:5].
[^q]: 1:18 <b class="catch-word">Netherworld**: Greek Hades, Hebrew Sheol, the abode of the dead; cf. [Rev 20:13–14]; [Nm 16:33].
[^r]: 1:19 <b class="catch-word">What you have seen, and what is happening, and what will happen afterwards**: the three parts of the Book of Revelation, the vision ([Rev 1:10–20]), the situation in the seven churches ([Rev 2–3]), and the events of [Rev 6–22].
[^s]: 1:20 <b class="catch-word">Secret meaning**: literally, “mystery.” <b class="catch-word">Angels**: these are the presiding spirits of the seven churches. Angels were thought to be in charge of the physical world (cf. [Rev 7:1]; [14:18]; [16:5]) and of nations ([Dn 10:13]; [12:1]), communities (the seven churches), and individuals ([Mt 18:10]; [Acts 12:15]). Some have seen in the “angel” of each of the seven churches its pastor or a personification of the spirit of the congregation.
