# Amos 1 (New American Bible (Revised Edition))
## Chapter 1

###### 1 The words of Amos, who was one of the sheepbreeders from Tekoa,[^A] which he received in a vision concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam, son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.[^a]  
###### 2 He said:
The LORD roars from Zion,[^b]  
    and raises his voice from Jerusalem;  
The pastures of the shepherds languish,  
    and the summit of Carmel withers.[^B]

## Aram

###### 3 Thus says the LORD:
For three crimes of Damascus, and now four--[^d]  
    I will not take it back--  
Because they threshed Gilead  
    with sledges of iron,  

###### 4 I will send fire upon the house of Hazael,  
    and it will devour the strongholds of Ben-hadad.[^e][^C]  

###### 5 I will break the barred gate of Damascus;  
    From the Valley of Aven[^f] I will cut off the one enthroned,  
And the sceptered ruler from Beth-eden;  
    the people of Aram shall be exiled to Kir,[^D] says the LORD.

## Philistia

###### 6 Thus says the LORD:
For three crimes of Gaza, and now four--  
    I will not take it back--  
Because they exiled an entire population,  
    handing them over to Edom,  

###### 7 I will send fire upon the wall of Gaza,  
    and it will devour its strongholds;  

###### 8 From Ashdod I will cut off the one enthroned  
    and the sceptered ruler from Ashkelon;  
I will turn my hand against Ekron,  
    and the last of the Philistines shall perish,  
    says the Lord God.

## Tyre

###### 9 Thus says the LORD:
For three crimes of Tyre, and now four--  
    I will not take it back--  
Because they handed over an entire population to Edom,  
    and did not remember their covenant of brotherhood,[^g]  

###### 10 I will send fire upon the wall of Tyre,  
    and it will devour its strongholds.

## Edom

###### 11 Thus says the LORD:
For three crimes of Edom, and now four--  
    I will not take it back--  
Because he pursued his brother[^h] with the sword,  
    suppressing all pity,  
Persisting in his anger,  
    his wrath raging without end,  

###### 12 I will send fire upon Teman,  
    and it will devour the strongholds of Bozrah.[^i]

## Ammon

###### 13 Thus says the LORD:
For three crimes of the Ammonites, and now four--  
    I will not take it back--  
Because they ripped open pregnant women in Gilead,[^E]  
    in order to extend their territory,  

###### 14 I will kindle a fire upon the wall of Rabbah,[^j]  
    and it will devour its strongholds  
Amid war cries on the day of battle,  
    amid stormwind on the day of tempest.  

###### 15 Their king shall go into exile,  
    he and his princes with him, says the LORD.

### Footnotes
[^a]: 1:1 <b class="catch-word">The earthquake**: a major earthquake during the reign of Uzziah (ca. 783–742 B.C.), so devastating that it was remembered long afterwards (cf. [Zec 14:5]). See the description of an earthquake in Amos’s final vision ([9:1]).
[^b]: 1:2 Significantly, the roar comes to the Northern Kingdom from Jerusalem. This verse, perhaps an editorial remark, sets the tone of Amos’s message.
[^c]: 1:3–2:16 All the nations mentioned here may have been part of the ideal empire of David-Solomon (cf. [1 Kgs 5:1]; [2 Kgs 14:25]). Certain standards of conduct were expected not only in their relations with Israel but also with one another.
[^d]: 1:3 <b class="catch-word">For three crimes…and now four**: this formula (n, n + 1) is frequent in poetry (e.g., [Prv 6:16–19]; [30:18–19]). The progression “three” followed by “four” here suggests a climax. The fourth crime is one too many and exhausts the Lord’s forbearance.
[^e]: 1:4 <b class="catch-word">Hazael…Ben-hadad**: kings of the Arameans whose capital was Damascus ([v. 5]); they fought against Israel ([2 Kgs 13:3]) and had long occupied the region of Gilead ([v. 3]) in Transjordan.
[^f]: 1:5 <b class="catch-word">Valley of Aven**: lit., “valley of wickedness,” perhaps a distortion of a place name in Aramean territory, identity unknown. <b class="catch-word">Beth-eden**: an Aramean city-state on the Euphrates, about two hundred miles northeast of Damascus, called _Bit-adini_ in Assyro-Babylonian texts. <b class="catch-word">Kir**: cf. [9:7]; probably to be identified with the city of Emar on the Euphrates, a major Aramean center in the Late Bronze Age. One text from this site calls the king of Emar “the king of the people of the land of Kir.”
[^g]: 1:9 <b class="catch-word">Did not remember their covenant of brotherhood**: standard diplomatic language of this period, meaning “violated the treaty.” The violation may not have been against Israel itself but against a fellow “subject” nation of the ideal Davidic-Solomonic empire (cf. [2:1]).
[^h]: 1:11 <b class="catch-word">Pursued his brother**: “brother” here may denote a fellow vassal or subject of Israel.
[^i]: 1:12 <b class="catch-word">Teman…Bozrah**: two of the chief cities of Edom; cf. [Jer 49:20].
[^j]: 1:14 <b class="catch-word">Rabbah**: now called Amman, the modern capital of Jordan.
