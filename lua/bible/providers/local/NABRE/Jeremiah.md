## Call of Jeremiah

###### 4 The word of the LORD came to me:  

###### 5 Before I formed you in the womb I knew you,  
    before you were born I dedicated you,  
    a prophet to the nations I appointed you.[^b][^C]  

###### 6 "Ah, Lord God!" I said,  
    "I do not know how to speak. I am too young!"[^c]  

###### 7 But the LORD answered me,  
Do not say, "I am too young."  
    To whomever I send you, you shall go;  
    whatever I command you, you shall speak.  

###### 8 Do not be afraid of them,  
    for I am with you to deliver you--oracle of the LORD.

###### 9 Then the LORD extended his hand and touched my mouth, saying to me,
See, I place my words in your mouth![^D]  

###### 10     Today I appoint you  
    over nations and over kingdoms,  
To uproot and to tear down,  
    to destroy and to demolish,  
    to build and to plant.

###### 11 The word of the LORD came to me: What do you see, Jeremiah? "I see a branch of the almond tree,"[^d] I replied.  
###### 12 Then the LORD said to me: You have seen well, for I am watching over my word to carry it out.  
###### 13 [^E]A second time the word of the LORD came to me: What do you see? I replied, "I see a boiling kettle whose mouth is tipped away from the north."[^e]

###### 14 The LORD said to me, And from the north evil will pour out over all who dwell in the land.[^F]

###### 15 Look, I am summoning  
    all the kingdoms of the north--oracle of the LORD--  
Each king shall come and set up his throne  
    in the gateways of Jerusalem,  
Against all its surrounding walls  
    and against all the cities of Judah.[^G]  

###### 16 I will pronounce my sentence against them  
    for all their wickedness in forsaking me,  
In burning incense to other gods,  
    in bowing down to the works of their hands.[^H]  

###### 17 But you, prepare yourself;  
    stand up and tell them  
    all that I command you.  
Do not be terrified on account of them,  
    or I will terrify you before them;  

###### 18 For I am the one who today  
    makes you a fortified city,  
A pillar of iron, a wall of bronze,  
    against the whole land:  
Against Judah's kings and princes,  
    its priests and the people of the land.[^I]  

###### 19 They will fight against you, but not prevail over you,  
    for I am with you to deliver you--oracle of the LORD.

### Footnotes
[^a]: 1:1 <b class="catch-word">Anathoth**: a village about three miles northeast of Jerusalem, to which Solomon had exiled Abiathar the priest ([1 Kgs 2:26–27]); it is likely that Jeremiah belonged to that priestly family.
[^b]: 1:5 Jeremiah was destined to become a prophet before his birth; cf. [Is 49:1], [5]; [Lk 1:15]; [Gal 1:15–16]. <b class="catch-word">I knew you**: I loved you and chose you. <b class="catch-word">I dedicated you**: I set you apart to be a prophet. <b class="catch-word">The nations**: the neighbors of Judah, along with Assyria, Babylonia, and Egypt.
[^c]: 1:6 <b class="catch-word">I am too young**: like Moses ([Ex 3:11], [13]; [4:10]), Jeremiah at first resists God’s call. This narrative is perhaps patterned after the story of Moses’ call in order to identify Jeremiah as the prophet “like me” in [Dt 18:15].
[^d]: 1:11 There is wordplay between the Hebrew noun _shaqed_, “almond tree,” and the Hebrew verb _shoqed_, “watcher/watching.” Because the almond tree begins to bloom in late winter in Palestine, it is called “the watcher” for the coming of spring. God is also “watcher,” observing the fulfillment of the prophetic word.
[^e]: 1:13 <b class="catch-word">Kettle…the north**: symbol of an invasion from the north; cf. [vv. 14–15].
