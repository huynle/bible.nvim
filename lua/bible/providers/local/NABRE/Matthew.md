## Chapter 1
<b class="inline-h3">The Genealogy of Jesus.**[^a] 
###### 1 [^A]The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.[^b]

###### 2 [^B]Abraham became the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers.[^C]  
###### 3 Judah became the father of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar.[^D] Perez became the father of Hezron, Hezron the father of Ram,  
###### 4 [^E]Ram the father of Amminadab. Amminadab became the father of Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon,  
###### 5 [^F]Salmon the father of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab. Boaz became the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth. Obed became the father of Jesse,  
###### 6 [^G]Jesse the father of David the king.
David became the father of Solomon, whose mother had been the wife of Uriah.  
###### 7 [^c][^H]Solomon became the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Asaph.  
###### 8 Asaph became the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, Joram the father of Uzziah.  
###### 9 Uzziah became the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of Hezekiah.  
###### 10 Hezekiah became the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amos,[^d] Amos the father of Josiah.  
###### 11 Josiah became the father of Jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the Babylonian exile.

###### 12 [^I]After the Babylonian exile, Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,  
###### 13 Zerubbabel the father of Abiud. Abiud became the father of Eliakim, Eliakim the father of Azor,  
###### 14 Azor the father of Zadok. Zadok became the father of Achim, Achim the father of Eliud,  
###### 15 Eliud the father of Eleazar. Eleazar became the father of Matthan, Matthan the father of Jacob,  
###### 16 Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary. Of her was born Jesus who is called the Messiah.

###### 17 Thus the total number of generations from Abraham to David is fourteen generations; from David to the Babylonian exile, fourteen generations; from the Babylonian exile to the Messiah, fourteen generations.[^e]
<b class="inline-h3">The Birth of Jesus.**[^f]  
###### 18 Now this is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about. When his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph,[^g] but before they lived together, she was found with child through the holy Spirit.  
###### 19 Joseph her husband, since he was a righteous man,[^h] yet unwilling to expose her to shame, decided to divorce her quietly.  
###### 20 [^J]Such was his intention when, behold, the angel of the Lord[^i] appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife into your home. For it is through the holy Spirit that this child has been conceived in her.  
###### 21 She will bear a son and you are to name him Jesus,[^j] because he will save his people from their sins."  
###### 22 All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet:

###### 23 [^k][^K]"Behold, the virgin shall be with child and bear a son,  
    and they shall name him Emmanuel,"
which means "God is with us."  
###### 24 When Joseph awoke, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took his wife into his home.  
###### 25 He had no relations with her until she bore a son,[^l] and he named him Jesus.[^L]

### Footnotes
[^a]: 1:1 <b class="catch-word">The Son of David, the son of Abraham**: two links of the genealogical chain are singled out. Although the later, David is placed first in order to emphasize that Jesus is the royal Messiah. The mention of Abraham may be due not only to his being the father of the nation Israel but to Matthew’s interest in the universal scope of Jesus’ mission; cf. [Gn 22:18] “…. in your descendants all the nations of the earth shall find blessing.”
[^b]: 1:7 The successor of Abijah was not Asaph but Asa (see [1 Chr 3:10]). Some textual witnesses read the latter name; however, <b class="catch-word">Asaph** is better attested. Matthew may have deliberately introduced the psalmist Asaph into the genealogy (and in [Mt 1:10] the prophet Amos) in order to show that Jesus is the fulfillment not only of the promises made to David (see [2 Sm 7]) but of all the Old Testament.
[^c]: 1:10 <b class="catch-word">Amos**: some textual witnesses read <b class="catch-word">Amon**, who was the actual successor of Manasseh (see [1 Chr 3:14]).
[^d]: 1:17 Matthew is concerned with fourteen generations, probably because fourteen is the numerical value of the Hebrew letters forming the name of David. In the second section of the genealogy ([Mt 1:6b–11]), three kings of Judah, Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah, have been omitted (see [1 Chr 3:11–12]), so that there are fourteen generations in that section. Yet the third ([Mt 1:12–16]) apparently has only thirteen. Since Matthew here emphasizes that each section has fourteen, it is unlikely that the thirteen of the last was due to his oversight. Some scholars suggest that <b class="catch-word">Jesus who is called the Messiah** ([Mt 1:16b]) doubles the final member of the chain: <b class="catch-word">Jesus**, born within the family of David, opens up the new age as <b class="catch-word">Messiah**, so that in fact there are fourteen generations in the third section. This is perhaps too subtle, and the hypothesis of a slip not on the part of Matthew but of a later scribe seems likely. On <b class="catch-word">Messiah**, see note on [Lk 2:11].
[^e]: 1:18–25 This first story of the infancy narrative spells out what is summarily indicated in [Mt 1:16]. The virginal conception of Jesus is the work of the Spirit of God. Joseph’s decision to divorce Mary is overcome by the heavenly command that he take her into his home and accept the child as his own. The natural genealogical line is broken but the promises to David are fulfilled; through Joseph’s adoption the child belongs to the family of David. Matthew sees the virginal conception as the fulfillment of [Is 7:14].
[^f]: 1:18 <b class="catch-word">Betrothed to Joseph**: betrothal was the first part of the marriage, constituting a man and woman as husband and wife. Subsequent infidelity was considered adultery. The betrothal was followed some months later by the husband’s taking his wife into his home, at which time normal married life began.
[^g]: 1:19 <b class="catch-word">A righteous man**: as a devout observer of the Mosaic law, Joseph wished to break his union with someone whom he suspected of gross violation of the law. It is commonly said that the law required him to do so, but the texts usually given in support of that view, e.g., [Dt 22:20–21] do not clearly pertain to Joseph’s situation. <b class="catch-word">Unwilling to expose her to shame**: the penalty for proved adultery was death by stoning; cf. [Dt 22:21–23].
[^h]: 1:20 <b class="catch-word">The angel of the Lord**: in the Old Testament a common designation of God in communication with a human being. <b class="catch-word">In a dream**: see [Mt 2:13], [19], [22]. These dreams may be meant to recall the dreams of Joseph, son of Jacob the patriarch ([Gn 37:5–11], [19]). A closer parallel is the dream of Amram, father of Moses, related by Josephus (_Antiquities_ 2:212, 215–16).
[^i]: 1:21 <b class="catch-word">Jesus**: in first-century Judaism the Hebrew name Joshua (Greek _Iēsous_) meaning “Yahweh helps” was interpreted as “Yahweh saves.”
[^j]: 1:23 <b class="catch-word">God is with us**: God’s promise of deliverance to Judah in Isaiah’s time is seen by Matthew as fulfilled in the birth of Jesus, in whom God is with his people. The name Emmanuel is alluded to at the end of the gospel where the risen Jesus assures his disciples of his continued presence, “…I am with you always, until the end of the age” ([Mt 28:20]).
[^k]: 1:25 <b class="catch-word">Until she bore a son**: the evangelist is concerned to emphasize that Joseph was not responsible for the conception of Jesus. The Greek word translated “until” does not imply normal marital conduct after Jesus’ birth, nor does it exclude it.
