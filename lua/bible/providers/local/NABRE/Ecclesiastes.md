# Ecclesiastes 1 (New American Bible (Revised Edition))
## Chapter 1

###### 1 The words of David's son, Qoheleth, king in Jerusalem:[^a][^A]

###### 2 Vanity of vanities,[^b] says Qoheleth,  
    vanity of vanities! All things are vanity![^B]

## Vanity of Human Toil

###### 3 What profit have we from all the toil  
    which we toil at under the sun?[^c][^C]  

###### 4 One generation departs and another generation comes,  
    but the world forever stays.  

###### 5 The sun rises and the sun sets;  
    then it presses on to the place where it rises.  

###### 6 Shifting south, then north,  
    back and forth shifts the wind, constantly shifting its course.  

###### 7 All rivers flow to the sea,  
    yet never does the sea become full.  
To the place where they flow,  
    the rivers continue to flow.  

###### 8 All things are wearisome,[^d]  
    too wearisome for words.  
The eye is not satisfied by seeing  
    nor has the ear enough of hearing.[^D]

###### 9 What has been, that will be; what has been done, that will be done. Nothing is new under the sun![^E]  
###### 10 Even the thing of which we say, "See, this is new!" has already existed in the ages that preceded us.[^F]  
###### 11 There is no remembrance of past generations;[^G] nor will future generations be remembered by those who come after them.[^e]
<b class="inline-h3">Twofold Introduction.** 
###### 12 I, Qoheleth, was king over Israel in Jerusalem,  
###### 13 and I applied my mind to search and investigate in wisdom all things that are done under the sun.[^H]
A bad business God has given  
    to human beings to be busied with.

###### 14 I have seen all things that are done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and a chase after wind.[^f][^I]

###### 15 What is crooked cannot be made straight,  
    and you cannot count what is not there.[^g]

###### 16 [^J]Though I said to myself, "See, I have greatly increased my wisdom beyond all who were before me in Jerusalem, and my mind has broad experience of wisdom and knowledge,"  
###### 17 yet when I applied my mind to know wisdom and knowledge, madness and folly, I learned that this also is a chase after wind.[^K]

###### 18 For in much wisdom there is much sorrow;  
    whoever increases knowledge increases grief.[^h]

### Footnotes
[^a]: 1:1 <b class="catch-word">David’s son…king in Jerusalem**: the intent of the author is to identify himself with Solomon. This is a literary device, by which the author hopes to commend his work to the public under the name of Israel’s most famous sage (see [1 Kgs 5:9–14]).
[^b]: 1:2 <b class="catch-word">Vanity of vanities**: a Hebrew superlative expressing the supreme degree of futility and emptiness.
[^c]: 1:3 <b class="catch-word">Under the sun**: used throughout this book to signify “on the earth.”
[^d]: 1:8 <b class="catch-word">All things are wearisome**: or, “All speech is wearisome.”
[^e]: 1:11 Movement in nature and human activity appears to result in change and progress. The author argues that this change and progress are an illusion: “Nothing is new under the sun.”
[^f]: 1:14 <b class="catch-word">A chase after wind**: an image of futile activity, like an attempt to corral the winds; cf. [Hos 12:2]. The ancient versions understood “affliction, dissipation of the spirit.” This phrase concludes sections of the text as far as [6:9].
[^g]: 1:15 <b class="catch-word">You cannot count what is not there**: perhaps originally a commercial metaphor alluding to loss or deficit in the accounts ledger.
[^h]: 1:18 <b class="catch-word">Sorrow…grief**: these terms refer not just to a store of knowledge or to psychological or emotional pain. Corporal punishment, sometimes quite harsh, was also employed frequently by parents and teachers.
