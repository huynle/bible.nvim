# John 3:16-4:15 (New American Bible (Revised Edition))
16 For God so loved the world that he gave[^a] his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him might not perish but might have eternal life.[^A]  17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn[^b] the world, but that the world might be saved through him.[^B]  18 Whoever believes in him will not be condemned, but whoever does not believe has already been condemned, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.[^C]  19 [^c]And this is the verdict,[^D] that the light came into the world, but people preferred darkness to light, because their works were evil.  20 For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come toward the light, so that his works might not be exposed.[^E]  21 But whoever lives the truth comes to the light, so that his works may be clearly seen as done in God.[^F]
<b class="inline-h3">Final Witness of the Baptist.** 22 [^d]After this, Jesus and his disciples went into the region of Judea, where he spent some time with them baptizing.[^G]  23 John was also baptizing in Aenon near Salim,[^e] because there was an abundance of water there, and people came to be baptized,  24 [^f][^H]for John had not yet been imprisoned.  25 Now a dispute arose between the disciples of John and a Jew[^g] about ceremonial washings.  26 So they came to John and said to him, "Rabbi, the one who was with you across the Jordan, to whom you testified, here he is baptizing and everyone is coming to him."[^I]  27 John answered and said, "No one can receive anything except what has been given him from heaven.[^J]  28 You yourselves can testify that I said [that] I am not the Messiah, but that I was sent before him.[^K]  29 The one who has the bride is the bridegroom; the best man,[^h] who stands and listens to him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice. So this joy of mine has been made complete.[^L]  30 He must increase; I must decrease."[^M]
<b class="inline-h3">The One from Heaven.**[^i]  31 The one who comes from above is above all. The one who is of the earth is earthly and speaks of earthly things. But the one who comes from heaven [is above all].[^N]  32 He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony.[^O]  33 Whoever does accept his testimony certifies that God is trustworthy.[^P]  34 For the one whom God sent speaks the words of God. He does not ration his gift[^j] of the Spirit.  35 The Father loves the Son and has given everything over to him.[^Q]  36 Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever disobeys the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains upon him.[^R]

## Chapter 4
1 [^k]Now when Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John  2 (although Jesus himself was not baptizing, just his disciples),[^l]  3 he left Judea and returned to Galilee.
<b class="inline-h3">The Samaritan Woman.** 4 He had to[^m] pass through Samaria.  5 So he came to a town of Samaria called Sychar,[^n] near the plot of land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.[^S]  6 Jacob's well was there. Jesus, tired from his journey, sat down there at the well. It was about noon.
7 A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, "Give me a drink."  8 His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.  9 [^o]The Samaritan woman said to him, "How can you, a Jew, ask me, a Samaritan woman, for a drink?"[^T] (For Jews use nothing in common with Samaritans.)  10 [^p]Jesus answered and said to her,[^U] "If you knew the gift of God and who is saying to you, 'Give me a drink,' you would have asked him and he would have given you living water."  11 [The woman] said to him, "Sir,[^q] you do not even have a bucket and the well is deep; where then can you get this living water?  12 Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us this well and drank from it himself with his children and his flocks?"[^V]  13 Jesus answered and said to her, "Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again;  14 but whoever drinks the water I shall give will never thirst; the water I shall give will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life."[^W]  15 The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water, so that I may not be thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water."

### Footnotes
[^a]: 3:16 <b class="catch-word">Gave**: as a gift in the incarnation, and also “over to death” in the crucifixion; cf. [Rom 8:32].
[^b]: 3:17–19 <b class="catch-word">Condemn**: the Greek root means both judgment and condemnation. Jesus’ purpose is to save, but his coming provokes judgment; some condemn themselves by turning from the light.
[^c]: 3:19 Judgment is not only future but is partially realized here and now.
[^d]: 3:22–26 Jesus’ ministry in Judea is only loosely connected with [Jn 2:13–3:21]; cf. [Jn 1:19–36]. Perhaps John the Baptist’s further testimony was transposed here to give meaning to “water” in [Jn 3:5]. Jesus is depicted as baptizing ([Jn 3:22]); contrast [Jn 4:2].
[^e]: 3:23 <b class="catch-word">Aenon near Salim**: site uncertain, either in the upper Jordan valley or in Samaria.
[^f]: 3:24 A remark probably intended to avoid objections based on a chronology like that of the synoptics ([Mt 4:12]; [Mk 1:14]).
[^g]: 3:25 <b class="catch-word">A Jew**: some think Jesus is meant. Many manuscripts read “Jews.”
[^h]: 3:29 <b class="catch-word">The best man**: literally, “the friend of the groom,” the _shoshben_ of Jewish tradition, who arranged the wedding. Competition between him and the groom would be unthinkable.
[^i]: 3:31–36 It is uncertain whether these are words by the Baptist, Jesus, or the evangelist. They are reflections on the two preceding scenes.
[^j]: 3:34 <b class="catch-word">His gift**: of God or to Jesus, perhaps both. This verse echoes [Jn 3:5], [8].
[^k]: 4:1–42 Jesus in Samaria. The self-revelation of Jesus continues with his second discourse, on his mission to “half-Jews.” It continues the theme of replacement, here with regard to cult ([Jn 4:21]). Water ([Jn 4:7–15]) serves as a symbol (as at Cana and in the Nicodemus episode).
[^l]: 4:2 An editorial refinement of [Jn 3:22], perhaps directed against followers of John the Baptist who claimed that Jesus imitated him.
[^m]: 4:4 <b class="catch-word">He had to**: a theological necessity; geographically, Jews often bypassed Samaria by taking a route across the Jordan.
[^n]: 4:5 <b class="catch-word">Sychar**: Jerome identifies this with Shechem, a reading found in Syriac manuscripts.
[^o]: 4:9 Samaritan women were regarded by Jews as ritually impure, and therefore Jews were forbidden to drink from any vessel they had handled.
[^p]: 4:10 <b class="catch-word">Living water**: the water of life, i.e., the revelation that Jesus brings; the woman thinks of “flowing water,” so much more desirable than stagnant well water. On John’s device of such misunderstanding, cf. note on [Jn 3:3].
[^q]: 4:11 <b class="catch-word">Sir**: the Greek _kyrios_ means “master” or “lord,” as a respectful mode of address for a human being or a deity; cf. [Jn 4:19]. It is also the word used in the Septuagint for the Hebrew _’adônai_, substituted for the tetragrammaton YHWH.
