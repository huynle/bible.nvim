### Footnotes
[^a]: 5:1–47 The self-revelation of Jesus continues in Jerusalem at a feast. The third sign (cf. [Jn 2:11]; [4:54])
 is performed, the cure of a paralytic by Jesus’ life-giving word. The water of the pool fails to bring life; Jesus
’ word does.
[^b]: 5:1 The reference in [Jn 5:45–46] to Moses suggests that the feast was Pentecost. The connection of that feas
t with the giving of the law to Moses on Sinai, attested in later Judaism, may already have been made in the first 
century. The feast could also be Passover (cf. [Jn 6:4]). John stresses that the day was a sabbath ([Jn 5:9]).
[^c]: 5:2 There is no noun with <b class="catch-word">Sheep**. “Gate” is supplied on the grounds that there must ha
ve been a gate in the NE wall of the temple area where animals for sacrifice were brought in; cf. [Neh 3:1], [32]; 
[12:39]. <b class="catch-word">Hebrew**: more precisely, Aramaic. <b class="catch-word">Bethesda**: preferred to va
riants “Be(th)zatha” and “Bethsaida”; _bêt-’ešdatayīn_ is given as the name of a double pool northeast of the templ
e area in the Qumran Copper Roll. <b class="catch-word">Five porticoes**: a pool excavated in Jerusalem actually ha
s five porticoes.
[^d]: 5:3 The Caesarean and Western recensions, followed by the Vulgate, add “waiting for the movement of the water
.” Apparently an intermittent spring in the pool bubbled up occasionally (see [Jn 5:7]). This turbulence was believ
ed to cure.
[^e]: 5:4 Toward the end of the second century in the West and among the fourth-century Greek Fathers, an additiona
l verse was known: “For [from time to time] an angel of the Lord used to come down into the pool; and the water was
 stirred up, so the first one to get in [after the stirring of the water] was healed of whatever disease afflicted 
him.” The angel was a popular explanation of the turbulence and the healing powers attributed to it. This verse is 
missing from all early Greek manuscripts and the earliest versions, including the original Vulgate. Its vocabulary 
is markedly non-Johannine.
