# John 5:1 (New American Bible (Revised Edition))
## Chapter 5[^a]
<b class="inline-h3">Cure on a Sabbath.** 
###### 1 After this, there was a feast[^b] of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.[^A]

### Footnotes
[^a]: 5:1–47 The self-revelation of Jesus continues in Jerusalem at a feast. The third sign (cf. [Jn 2:11]; [4:54]) is performed, the cure of a paralytic by Jesus’ life-giving word. The 
water of the pool fails to bring life; Jesus’ word does.
[^b]: 5:1 The reference in [Jn 5:45–46] to Moses suggests that the feast was Pentecost. The connection of that feast with the giving of the law to Moses on Sinai, attested in later Judai
sm, may already have been made in the first century. The feast could also be Passover (cf. [Jn 6:4]). John stresses that the day was a sabbath ([Jn 5:9]).
